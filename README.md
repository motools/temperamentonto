The Temperament Ontology
========================

About
-----

The [Temperament Ontology](http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/keys.owl#) can be used to give a detailed description of the tuning of an instrument. It is developed in the OMRAS2 project, and intended to be used in conjunction with the [Music Ontology](http://purl.org/ontology/mo/), for example, when describing the tuning that was used in a particular harpsichord recording.
